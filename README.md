# Computer Vision Rock, Paper, Scissors Game


## A description of the project: what it does, the  aim of the project, and what you learned

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock.

The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.

This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

In this project, I learnt about machine learning models and  the intricacies of implementing them into my code. 
I feel that my object oriented programming and general coding skills improved a lot

## Installation instructions

Run 'pip install requirements.txt' to download the necessary requirements for the game

## Usage instructions

In the repo. Find the repo converted_keras-4. Go to the final_game.py file and run the code. When the code starts, your webcam will open up, make sure you switch back to the code. The classic rock, paper, scissors countdown will appear. On "Shoot". Present to the computer either rock, paper, or scissors. If you do not present a valid option, the computer will ask you to go again. 
Here is how you should present each of your choices:
Rock:

Paper:

Scissors:

The computer will tell you who won the individual game between you and the computer, and the code will run until either you or the computer win 3 times, upon which an appropriate message will be displayed.

To terminate the code, go on the webcam and press q.

Good luck!

## File structure of the project

Each converted_keras folder includes a model from Teachable Machine
The code for the final game can be found in the most accurate model converted_keras-4. In converted_keras-3 you may find some files such as testfile.py and camera-rps.py. These files were intermediaries to get the whole code working in the final_game.py file in converted_keras-4.
